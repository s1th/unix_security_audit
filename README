unix_security_audit
===================

Description:

This script will extract security details from a AIX, Redhat, or Solaris system.
The output from the script should be redirected to a text file for offline viewing.
The goal in creating this was to be able to run it locally on any system and
produce a text file dump of all the details.

The security details extracted are in line with the requirements detailed in the
STIGs.  The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration
standards for DOD IA and IA-enabled devices/systems.  To see more on this topic
